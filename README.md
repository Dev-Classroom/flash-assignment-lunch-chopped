## Assignment Overview

Let's be honest: even in the best lunchrooms, the cyclical nature of limited three-week menus and reuse of the same components (just a bit differently each time) can be...underwhelming. In a small group, you're going to work as a design team to create a mind map and a storyboard for an app that allows users (students, teachers?) to suggest their own takes on how to zhuzh the lunchroom's offerings up a bit. You won't actually be designing anything for this assignment, but it will take some time to work together and create journeys for the users from first logging into the app to actually _doing_ something with it.

## Deliverables 

 - [ ] Mind map <br />
 - [ ] Story board for a user creating a 'recipe' <br />
 - [ ] Story board for a user searching, selecting, and providing feedback for a certain 'recipe' <br />
 - [ ] Story board for a user searching through all available 'recipes' <br />
